                            I have a strong foundation in programming languages such as <font color = "#00ffea">Python</font> and <font color = "#00ffea">C</font>, as well as a profound passion for <font color = "#00ffea">Game</font> and <font color = "#00ffea">App Development</font>. 
                            My academic journey at the University of Guelph has provided me with essential skills in <font color = "#00ffea">critical thinking</font> and <font color = "#00ffea">problem-solving</font>, 
                            while my <font color = "#00ffea">attention to detail</font> and <font color = "#00ffea">strong work ethic</font> have played a pivotal role in succeeding throughout various software projects.
                            <br><br>
                            In addition to my academic achievements, I've gained invaluable hands-on experience in <font color = "#00ffea">full-stack development</font> during my current role at <font color = "#00ffea">Tulip Retail</font>.
                            In this professional setting, I've expanded my technical expertise and worked collaboratively to create <font color = "#00ffea">innovative software solutions</font>. 
                            Moreover, in previous positions, I played a key role in providing <font color = "#00ffea">IT support</font> and <font color = "#00ffea">enhancing user experience</font> for the gym's website at <font color = "#00ffea">Dynamo Gymnastics</font>. 
                            I also <font color = "#00ffea">led the development of educational materials</font> for <font color = "#00ffea">JDOHSS</font> in their STEM program. 
                            Throughout these work experiences, I have consistently demonstrated effective <font color = "#00ffea">communication</font> and <font color = "#00ffea">teamwork</font>, 
                            fostering collaborative environments to achieve common goals and deliver successful results.
                            <br><br>

                    &emsp; He started by playing a heartwarming video of ten-year-old me, and then, with a playful smile, he asked me to step up and sing in front of the entire company.<br>
