                <h3> > MY ROLE </h3>
                <h3 class="text-pad"> I worked as a <font color = "#00ffea">Software Developer Co-op</font> on Tulip's <font color = "#00ffea">Clienteling team</font>, 
                    where proficiency in multiple programming languages, including <font color = "#00ffea">PHP</font>, 
                    <font color = "#00ffea">JavaScript</font>, <font color = "#00ffea">MySQL</font>, and <font color = "#00ffea">HTML</font>, was crucial. 
                    Most of these skills were acquired during my academic studies, along with expertise in <font color = "#00ffea">version control systems</font> 
                    like Git. Throughout my recent term at Tulip, my primary focus centered around <font color = "#00ffea">debugging</font>, 
                    allowing me to become well-acquainted with the <font color = "#00ffea">diverse technologies</font> integrated 
                    into the Clienteling platform. This role often required close collaboration with various team members, 
                    including product managers, designers, and seasoned developers, to craft <font color = "#00ffea">comprehensive solutions</font> 
                    encompassing <font color = "#00ffea">database management</font>, <font color = "#00ffea">API development</font>, 
                    and <font color = "#00ffea">user interface design</font>. I also actively contributed to <font color = "#00ffea">full-stack development</font> 
                    projects, significantly expanding my skill set. Tulip further provided me with invaluable opportunities to explore 
                    and apply additional programming languages, such as <font color = "#00ffea">Swift</font> and <font color = "#00ffea">GoLang</font>, 
                    and to immerse myself in <font color = "#00ffea">iOS development</font>. This experience greatly enriched 
                    my capabilities and contributed significantly to my growth as a software developer.</h3> <br><br>

                                With a long-standing interest in iOS development, I saw this as an opportunity to expand my skill set and 
                                knowledge. This aligns with my career aspirations, offering valuable insights and expertise that
                                 will contribute to my growth as a software developer.

                            <li>I aimed to take leadership in <font color = "#00ffea">improving documentation</font> at Tulip, recognizing its crucial role in 
                                enhancing understanding among team members. This goal aligned with my manager's emphasis on the importance
                                 of maintaining well-documented code, which contributes to the overall efficiency and effectiveness of our projects.

                                recognizing their critical importance in a workplace environment. I aimed to ensure that my 
                                communication remained effective, enabling me to convey ideas, collaborate with team members, 
                                and contribute to the success of our projects. This goal reflected my commitment to becoming a 
                                more proficient and valuable team member at Tulip.

                            <br>
                            <li>I set a goal to <font color = "#00ffea">attend at least 60% of the Learning Initiative discussions</font> at Tulip, 
                                which were established by the company to foster continuous learning in the workplace. 
                                My aim was not only to engage with fellow Tulip members from different teams but also to expand 
                                my knowledge by actively participating in discussions alongside video content and readings.

                                During Tulip's company hack day, I teamed up with a member of the iOS team, 
                                and it proved to be an incredible learning experience. Collaboratively, we employed 
                                <font color = "#00ffea">pair programming</font> to seamlessly integrate an application into the Apple Watch, enhancing 
                                the accessibility of the Tulip app on iPhone and iPad devices. Our development journey 
                                involved utilizing <font color = "#00ffea">Swift</font> and <font color = "#00ffea">XCode</font>, 
                                while leveraging <font color = "#00ffea">cloud integration</font> to retrieve data 
                                efficiently. This inspiring opportunity further fueled my interest in iOS, prompting me 
                                to initiate weekly meetings with that same member to learn more.</li>
                                <br>
                            <li>During the course of my work on a ticket, I encountered a situation where a crucial component
                                 for development on one of the platforms was omitted from the documentation. After 
                                 successfully completing the task, I took the initiative to update the readme file. 
                                 Shortly after, a team member who later worked on the same platform found the updated 
                                 documentation immensely helpful. While collaborating with a member of the iOS team, 
                                 I noticed their strong emphasis on documentation during project work. 
                                 This experience shed light on the importance of meticulous documentation in our 
                                 development process. He also imparted valuable lessons on how to simplify and streamline the 
                                 documentation process for maximum efficiency, which is something I will be able to utilize 
                                 throughout the rest of my career.</li>
                                 <br>
                            <li>Throughout the term, I demonstrated strong communication skills during presentations on hack day
                                 and while leading team meetings. I felt confident, maintained clarity, and avoided getting stuck. 
                                 However, I've noticed that I can sometimes struggle to explain the process I followed to arrive at a 
                                 solution or the various steps I took when troubleshooting a bug to those who are unfamiliar with the 
                                 issue. This is an aspect I am actively addressing and aiming to improve.</li>

                            <li>
                                I have actively participated in 60% of these learning initiatives and have 
                                gained a lot from doing so. They have provided valuable insights into avoiding 
                                common software-related mistakes, exploring diverse technologies, and 
                                understanding the strategies companies, including Tulip, are employing to progress. 
                                Additionally, these initiatives have allowed me to connect with individuals beyond my 
                                immediate team, emphasizing the company's commitment to fostering collective learning. 
                                Attending these sessions has unquestionably been a highlight of my week, equipping me

                            <li>Regrettably, this hasn't occurred as of now. However, it's probable that I'll collaborate 
                                with my manager, Lindsay, on a feature during my upcoming term. 
                                This past term, I've been assigned to resolve numerous bugs across different aspects of clienteling. 
                                This has occasionally provided me with the opportunity to engage with members of other teams, 
                                offering me valuable insights and helping me refine my future career goals as a developer.</li></h3>
